# Custom Soundboard
Spring 2017 ScriptEd hackathon
ScriptEd hackathon project made by Noah, Jeremiah and Ray.

## Features

- Creating and using a custom soundboard
- Programming a song using keybindings

## How we built it

Using the HTML5 audio tag and sound samples downloaded from royalty-free sites, we added all the audio files to the page. Using keypress event listeners, we can bind each sample to a key. By storing the timing of individual keypresses, we can record a song and replay it.

## Challenges we ran into

- Learning the HTML5 audio API
- Cleanly doing keybindings
- Recording and playback

## What we learned

- Using Boostrap for styling
- Playing audio
- ES6 syntax

## Future Vision

- Collaborative soundboard: share a session with a friend and create together!
- Recording, editing, and playback: record a session and come back to it later!
